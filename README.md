## Problem Statement

Create a page that displays the calendar for the user. Selecting a longer period of days
should display the tally of HRD, Tech 1, Follow up and Total for each day.

This should also be the case if you have fewer days with the additional functionality of
showing the priority factor categorized as high or low based on the total.

Selecting a single day should display the individual tabs with their personal details alongside
the priority factor. There also is a requirement for a dialer integration to open the call
application with userâ€™s phone number. There should be no page reload at any step during
the entire journey. Please refer the wireframes to design and add any design deeming fit or
missing. Publish the code on GitHub as a public repository for review.
